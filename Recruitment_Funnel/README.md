HR Analytics Data Cleaning & Preparation Project

Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, MySQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Dataset: Kaggle: HR Analytics Job Change of Data Scientists
Goal: Prepare and clean HR candidate data for analytics and modeling

Data Cleaning Workflow Across Tools:
Excel:

Used IF, ISBLANK, MEDIAN, and FILTER formulas to detect and treat missing values.

Used Pivot Tables to assess null counts and data distribution.

Python (Pandas + NumPy):

Filled missing categorical fields with 'Unknown' and numeric fields with column median.

Exported clean dataset for modeling and visualization.

SQL (MySQL):

Standardized experience and job change columns and filled NULLs with median values or placeholders ('Unknown').

Exported clean table for BI integration.

Power BI:

Used Power Query Editor to replace special characters and nulls across multiple columns.

Created calculated columns for binned experience ranges and encoded job change indicators.

Enabled drill-down filtering across dimensions like gender, education, and company size.

Outputs:
Cleaned, analysis-ready dataset with standardized categorical values, treated missing data, and numeric columns ready for modeling.

Dataset visualized using Power BI & Excel dashboards.

Strong EDA foundation for building predictive models or business dashboards.

Why This Matters:
This project demonstrates my ability to clean real-world messy data using multiple tools critical for analytics, dashboarding, and machine learning.
