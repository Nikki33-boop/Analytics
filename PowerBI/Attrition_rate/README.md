An interactive Attrition Insights Dashboard designed to analyze employee turnover trends and help HR or management make data-driven decisions.

Started by Power Query Editor to prepare and clean the data. This included:

Removing duplicates and handling missing values, Transforming data types, Creating custom columns, like tenure buckets and age groups we shaped the raw data into a format that’s clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

Moved into the Data Model view, established relationships between tables—such as linking employee demographics, job roles, and attrition records. 

We also created DAX measures to calculate important KPIs like:

Overall attrition rate
Attrition by department, gender, or age group
Average tenure and satisfaction scores for current vs. exited employees


We added slicers and filters to make the report interactive—so users can slice the data by department, job level, or marital status and see how trends shift 

In short, this project demonstrates end-to-end Power BI capabilities—from data transformation in Power Query, to relationship building and DAX in the Data Model, all the way to building an engaging, insightful dashboard.
