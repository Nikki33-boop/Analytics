Data Cleaning: The first step includes checking the data for duplicates, errors, or differentiated multiple entries. This also includes changig the data types in the csv files as database would not take data if not in correct format. For example SQL server "Date' to be in YYYY-MM-DD format and if the date in the file is not in this format database might show error while inserting the data in the table


Inserting Data in SQL Database: Here we create a database wherein we create table to import the data from excel or csv files. To note particularly includes having the columns arranged in the order of the columns created in the database. For adding additoinal data we need to make sure that we add data to table created in the database which we are using for visualization in PowerBI


Data Processing: Once database is imported in Power BI we work on creating new coloumns or measures as per requirements. The requirements include what KPIs we will include and what kind of analysis we need to present to the stakeholder as per their requirements.


Exploratory Data Analysis: Creating graphs and forming correlations between the drawn out variables to understand the relationship.


Visualiization: Creating the dashboard that includes all the insights, indicators, filters, and correlations
