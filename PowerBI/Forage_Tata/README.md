My first step was to transform the data into Power BI. I noticed mismatched data, that included different data types, negative quantities and units sold, also issue with date-time column.

To address this:

•	I removed the rows with negative values in Quantity and units Sold column by filtering out the data.

•	As mentioned in the requirements by you I found we only required the date and not the time hence changed the data type of date time column to only of date.

•	Most of the insights required the metric for revenue so I added a custom column for revenue by multiplying the Units Sold column with Quantity for each row and changed its data type to Whole number.

This clean-up ensured that the insights generated were reliable.

Final Recommendations

To wrap up:

•	Double down on your top products and expand offerings to growing segments

•	Focus expansion in high-potential but currently underperforming regions.

•	Leverage seasonal patterns to time campaigns and product launches.

•	Maintain clean, real-time data practices to ensure future decisions are data-driven.
