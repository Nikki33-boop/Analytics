Conducted an end-to-end customer churn analysis using Python in a Jupyter Notebook to understand why customers are leaving a telecom service provider.

Started by loading and inspecting the dataset using pandas, performing data cleaning tasks such as:

Replacing blank spaces in the TotalCharges column and converting it from string to float
Checking for null values and removing duplicates
Transforming binary variables like SeniorCitizen from 0/1 to 'Yes'/'No' for easier interpretation

Next conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visual tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Created a variety of insightful visualizations:

Count plots and pie charts showing overall churn rates
Bar charts comparing churn across categories like gender, contract type, and senior citizen status
Stacked bar charts and histograms to analyze how tenure and service usage patterns relate to churn behavior

Found that churn was significantly higher among customers with month-to-month contracts, limited service features, and shorter tenure—especially among senior citizens.

This project showcased a strong application of data preprocessing, visual storytelling, and pattern recognition, all critical for identifying at-risk customer groups. The insights can be used by the business to focus retention efforts and improve customer satisfaction.
